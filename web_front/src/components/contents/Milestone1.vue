    <h2> Performance in a bear market </h2>
    <h3> Defensive </h3>

    <p>
      In a bear market, the bond attributes of convertible bonds make them somewhat defensive. When the stock market
      falls, the price of convertible bonds tends to be more stable than the shares, because they have a fixed interest
      income and repayment of capital at maturity. This "retreat can be defended" feature makes the convertible bonds in
      the market down when investors become a hedge choice.
    </p>
    <h3> Debt floor protection</h3>
    The pure debt value of convertible bonds provides a price floor. In a bear market, as the price of convertible bonds
    falls, their underbelly value gradually becomes supportive, limiting the further downside of the price.
    <h3>Stable income</h3>
    Although the capital appreciation potential of convertible bonds is limited in a bear market, they can still provide
    relatively stable interest income, which is an attractive feature for investors seeking fixed income.
    <h3>Strategic choice</h3>

    In a bear market, investors may look for low valuation convertible bonds to allocate, especially those with higher
    debt floor protection and lower conversion premiums, in anticipation of gains when the market rebounds.
    <h2>Performance in a bull market</h2>
    <h3>Strengthened equity</h3>
    In a bull market, as the price of the underlying stock rises, the conversion value of convertible bonds increases
    and their equity characteristics are strengthened. This allows the price of the convertible bond to follow the price
    of the underlying stock, thus providing opportunities for capital appreciation.
    <h3>Participation in market rises</h3>
    Convertible bonds allow investors to participate in stock market rises, but at the same time offer lower risk than
    holding shares directly. This is because even if the stock market pulls back, the bond attributes of convertibles
    provide a degree of protection.
    <h3>Conversion potential</h3>
    In a bull market environment, the conversion terms of convertible bonds become attractive as investors can
    participate in the rise of the underlying stock through conversion without having to take on excessive risk.
    <h3>Valuation stretch </h3>
    Higher investor expectations of growth in a bull market may lead to higher valuations of convertible bonds, i.e. an
    increase in the conversion premium. This may dampen the price rise of convertible bonds to a certain extent, but at
    the same time provides investors with an opportunity to gain through conversion.
