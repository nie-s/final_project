      The first stage "trial period" (2001-2010.6). After the China Securities Regulatory Commission issued the
      "Implementation Measures for Issuance of Convertible Bonds by Listed Companies" and the "Notice on Doing a
      Good
      Job in Issuance of Convertible Bonds by Listed Companies" in 2001, the convertible bond market also ushered
      in
      a
      small wave of climax, and the convertible bond market emerged (Arshanapalli et al., 2004).

      The second stage "exploration period" (2010.06-2017.02). This stage was marked by the issuance of BOC
      convertible bonds worth 40 billion yuan, and the expansion speed of the convertible bond market accelerated
      significantly. In fact, before the issuance of BOC convertible bonds, the single size of the convertible
      bond
      market was relatively small. The BOC convertible bonds came out unexpectedly on June 2, 2010, with an
      issuance
      scale of up to 40 billion yuan (Albul et al., 2010). Since then, large-cap convertible bonds represented by
      the
      banking industry have been intensively issued, and the average scale of single issuance has jumped to 4.9
      billion yuan, an increase of nearly 10 times. During this stage, the price trend and issuance rhythm of
      convertible bonds fluctuated under the influence of positive stocks until the "crazy bull" market and
      subsequent
      stock market crash around 2015. Many convertible bonds withdrew from the market, and the balance of
      convertible
      bonds in the market fell sharply to below 20 billion yuan (Duca et al., 2012).

      The third stage can be temporarily called the "growth period" (from February 2017 to the present). This
      stage
      is
      marked by the revision of some articles of the "Implementation Rules for Non-public Issuance of Shares by
      Listed
      Companies" by the China Securities Regulatory Commission on February 17, 2017 (Oster, 2020). Many policies
      with
      profound impacts were launched in that year, including but not limited to: the issuance of the "Several
      Provisions on the Reduction of Shareholdings by Shareholders, Directors, Supervisors, and Senior Executives
      of
      Listed Companies" on May 27, which restricted and constrained shareholders of listed companies from reducing
      their shareholdings through block trading, "bridge sales," "clearance sales," and directors, supervisors,
      and
      senior executives from reducing their shareholdings through resignation; and the issuance of the revised
      "Measures for the Issuance and Underwriting of Securities" on September 8, which changed the issuance method
      of
      convertible bonds and exchangeable bonds from capital subscription to credit subscription (Liao et al.,
      2022).
      2017 can be regarded as the "modern history year" of China's convertible bond market with the support of
      various
      new policies and regulations, the supply and demand of primary issuance in the convertible bond market are
      booming, and the scale has been greatly expanded (Liuling et al., 2022). The valuation of the secondary
      market
      has returned, and the allocation value has been improved. With increasing attention, the investor structure
      of
      the convertible bond market has become increasingly diversified, and the "golden era" of accelerated
      expansion
      has officially arrived (Dutordoir et al., 2022).
