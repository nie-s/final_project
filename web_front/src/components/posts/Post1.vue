      In terms of industry distribution, as of the end of 2023, under the classification of the CSRC, banking and
      finance
      tranches are still the largest institutional category in the market in terms of size, with the balance of the
      stock
      of tranches far exceeding that of other industry markers (Jo et al., 2023). Excluding bank tranches, the
      electrical,
      electronics and chemical industry tranches were the top three in terms of stock size. And from the point of view
      of
      only the number of stock coupons, the top three industries are electrical, electronic and chemical industries. The
      current stock of convertible bonds covered by a total of 63 industries, due to the convertible bonds have the
      characteristics of stocks, so its industry characteristics can be partially reflected in the price trend of
      convertible bonds (Abhyankar & Ho, 2006). With the continuous improvement of the covered industries, the
      stock-biased convertible bond strategy has also been given a wider industry allocation space.
