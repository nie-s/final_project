      The main holders of the convertible bond market after market expansion. The original shareholders of the company
      are
      one of the investor types with the highest holding ratio in the current stage of the convertible bond market
      (Dinsmore et al., 2016). One important reason is that the original shareholders of the issuer have the right to
      subscribe preferentially to the new convertible bonds issued in proportion to their shareholding ratio. Given the
      current overall high premium status of the market, the winning rate of the new strategy is high. Superimposed on
      the
      expansion trend of the convertible bond market since 2017, the original shareholders occupy a higher proportion in
      the current structure of convertible bond holders (Del Viva & El Hefnawy, 2020).

      The main way for original shareholders to participate in convertible bonds is to preferentially distribute to win
      new profits, so in terms of behavioral characteristics, they often reduce their holdings after the convertible
      bonds
      are listed (Ling et al., 2022). Although some original shareholders will choose to hold convertible bonds for a
      long
      time after participating in the preferential distribution due to concerns about the dilution of equity after the
      subsequent convertible bonds are converted into shares. However, from the historical cases so far, more
      shareholders
      will choose to reduce their holdings of convertible bonds first to earn new profits, and then increase their
      shares
      through other channels when they actually face equity dilution pressure to protect their own shareholding ratio
      (Jin
      et al., 2023).

      Overall, under the above behavioral characteristics, original shareholders often become the main allocation force
      when new convertible bonds are issued, and the subsequent trading direction is basically a one-way reduction.
      After
      listing, there are not many cases of large-scale holdings in the secondary market, and the trading activity is not
      high. The main trading volume is concentrated in the early stage of the listing of new convertible bonds.
