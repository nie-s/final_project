      Key transactional participants in the market as the second largest participating force in the convertible bond
      market, fund institutions have stronger transactional characteristics in trading behavior compared to general
      corporations as it should be noted that due to the different investment strategies of funds, they will show
      greatly differentiated behavioral characteristics in the convertible bond market (Li et al., 2016). For example,
      if a fund regards convertible bonds as a major investment category (such as convertible bond funds), and actively
      seeks high-elasticity returns of high-elasticity bonds relative to other fixed-income products, then under such
      participation strategies, this part of the fund will show a strong trading intention in the market; while for some
      funds that adopt a low-price allocation strategy, the trading behavior of convertible bonds is mainly to search
      for high-quality low-price varieties and hold them for a long time, so the trading intention reflected will be
      relatively low (Dutordoir et al., 2022). At the same time, it should be noted that many funds are relative income
      investors, which often makes their participation behavior in the convertible bond market often show linkage. For
      example, the continuous stretching of convertible bond valuations since 2019 is largely because many fund
      institutions that are relative income investors must choose to be forced into the convertible bond market.
