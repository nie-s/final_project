      Asset management and proprietary trading are also one of the important participants in the current convertible
      bond market. In terms of behavioral characteristics, before 2019, the biggest advantage of securities institutions
      was that they could obtain a larger scale of new bonds from the primary market through multi-account online
      subscription (Dutordoir et al., 2022). However, with the gradual improvement of related rules since March 2019,
      the special advantage of securities institutions in the subscription of new bonds no longer exists, and they can
      only participate in online subscription through a single account, which has also caused the holding scale of
      securities asset management and proprietary trading convertible bonds to decline thereafter (Jo et al., 2023).

      Overall, with the improvement of the subscription policy, the behavioral characteristics of securities asset
      management and proprietary trading have shown a strong similarity with public funds. But it should be noted that
      due to the different nature of funds, the trading behavior of convertible bonds of securities asset management and
      proprietary trading institutions will also have differences (Rahim et al., 2014). For example, the behavioral
      characteristics of securities asset management will be largely constrained by contracts. And because of the
      stability of funds, proprietary trading institutions can often carry out contrarian transactions, such as buying
      in reverse during pessimistic market periods (Lyandres & Zhdanov, 2014).
