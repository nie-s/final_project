      The holding ratio continues to increase, and the level requirements are relatively high Compared with securities
      firms and funds, insurance institutions often have higher requirements for the issuer’s credit rating and other
      related information (Choi et al., 2010). Overall, whether from the level preference or trading characteristics,
      insurance institutions tend to be stable when participating in the convertible bond market. And because some
      insurance asset management’s single fund scale is relatively large, they often have a higher allocation ratio for
      a single large-cap convertible bond, so reflected in trading behavior, they often have a longer period of increase
      and decrease, and the holding period may also be longer (after all, the liquidity of the convertible bond market
      is limited) while unlike public funds, insurance institutions do not pursue relative returns in their assessments,
      and the acceptable return period is also longer (Alderson et al., 2006). Therefore, considering various aspects,
      insurance institutions are a relatively stable allocation force in the convertible bond market.

      In terms of level, the range of convertible bond credit ratings that insurance institutions can accept is usually
      AA and above, and some institutions with strict requirements may even set the lower limit of the level at AA+. In
      contrast, the level requirements of public funds and securities asset management and proprietary trading
      institutions are usually set at AA- or A+ and above, which means that for many varieties with low credit ratings,
      insurance institutions are actually unable to participate (Szymanowska et al., 2009). This is also one of the
      important reasons why there is often a level premium phenomenon in the convertible bond market.
