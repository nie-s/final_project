      Pay close attention to the disturbance of individual investors for a long time, individual investors have not
      accounted for a high proportion among all participants in the convertible bond market, but in the previous
      speculative transactions, the behavior of individual investors has become one of the main forces driving the
      abnormal active trading in the market (Dutordoir et al., 2022). Individual investors, due to the influence of
      research capabilities and risk preferences, their behavior often exacerbates the price fluctuations of convertible
      bonds, and their investment targets are mainly concentrated on speculative bonds with typical characteristics such
      as ultra-high turnover rate, low rating, and small scale (Wu & Lee, 2014) </p>
