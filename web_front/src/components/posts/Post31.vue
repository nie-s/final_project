      <b> Defensive.</b>In a bear market, the bond attributes of convertible bonds make them somewhat defensive. When
      the stock
      market falls, the price of convertible bonds tends to be more stable than the shares, because they have a fixed
      interest income and repayment of capital at maturity and this "retreat can be defended" feature makes the
      convertible bonds in the market down when investors become a hedge choice (Lee & Loughran, 1998).

      <b>Debt Floor Protection.</b> The pure debt value of convertible bonds provides a price floor. In a bear market,
      as the
      price of convertible bonds falls, their underbelly value gradually becomes supportive, limiting the further
      downside
      of the price (Lee & Loughran, 1998).

      <b> Stable Income.</b>Although the capital appreciation potential of convertible bonds is limited in a bear
      market, they
      can still provide relatively stable interest income, which is an attractive feature for investors seeking fixed
      income (Abhyankar & Dunning, 1999).
    </p>


    <p>
      <b>Strategic Choice.</b> In a bear market, investors may look for low valuation convertible bonds to allocate,
      especially
      those with higher debt floor protection and lower conversion premiums, in anticipation of gains when the market
      rebounds (Carayannopoulos & Kalimipalli, 2003).
