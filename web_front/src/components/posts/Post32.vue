      <b>Strengthened Equity.</b> In a bull market, as the price of the underlying stock rises, the conversion value of
      convertible bonds increases and their equity characteristics are strengthened. This allows the price of the
      convertible bond to follow the price of the underlying stock, thus providing opportunities for capital
      appreciation (Dutordoir et al., 2014).
    </p>

    <p>
      <b> Participation in Market Rises.</b> Convertible bonds allow investors to participate in stock market rises, but
      at the same time offer lower risk than holding shares directly. This is because even if the stock market pulls
      back, the bond attributes of convertibles provide a degree of protection (Bechmann et al., 2014).
    </p>

    <p>
      <b> Conversion Potential.</b> In a bull market environment, the conversion terms of convertible bonds become
      attractive as investors can participate in the rise of the underlying stock through conversion without having to
      take on excessive risk (Szymanowska et al., 2009).
    </p>

    <p>
      <b> Valuation Stretch. </b>Higher investor expectations of growth in a bull market may lead to higher valuations
      of convertible bonds, i.e. an increase in the conversion premium. This may dampen the price rise of convertible
      bonds to a certain extent, but at the same time provides investors with an opportunity to gain through conversion
      (Kazbek et al., 2023).
