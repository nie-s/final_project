      <b> Underlying Stock Information.</b> The price of the underlying stock is a crucial factor in determining the
      price trend of convertible bonds. Thus, an initial comprehensive understanding of the underlying stock is
      necessary for further analysis. The analysis methods for the underlying stock of convertible bonds are essentially
      the same as those for equity securities, focusing on the companyâ€™s main business, industry trends, competitive
      landscape, upstream and downstream relationships, and revenue performance (Korkeamaki & Moore, 2004).

      <b>Scale.</b> The issuance scale of convertible bonds is significant because it can greatly influence the
      liquidity of a bond. On one hand, unlike the equity market, liquidity in the convertible bond market is not as
      smooth, so bonds with higher liquidity may receive a corresponding premium (Liu, 2020). On the other hand,
      larger-scale bonds have a greater capacity, possibly receiving higher allocations during new bond subscriptions
      and stock bond configurations (Billett et al., 2007).

      <b>Issuance Method.</b> Investors can participate in the subscription of convertible bonds through online or
      offline channels during the issuance (Korkeamaki & Moore, 2004). The offline subscription is primarily designed
      for institutional investors, allowing a higher subscription limit (often around 1 billion yuan); whereas, the
      online subscription is mainly aimed at public investors, with a permitted subscription limit of only 1 million
      yuan, and requires a lottery allocation based on the subscription rate (Liuling et al., 2022).
