      Initially, each convertible bond has a set conversion price, which must not be lower than the higher of the
      average trading price of the stock on the day before the prospectus is announced or the average trading price over
      the 20 days before issuance. After entering the conversion period (usually six months post-issuance), bonds can be
      converted into the corresponding number of shares at any time based on the face valueâ€”100 yuan divided by the
      conversion price and the converted stock can only be sold the next trading day after choosing to convert (Lau,
      2023).</p>
