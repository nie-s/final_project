      The terms related to the pure bond value determine its value as a bond, referred to as the convertible bond's pure
      bond value (Kim, 2020). Convertible bonds usually adopt a progressive interest rate and often provide a certain
      redemption compensation at maturity, making the redemption amount higher than the sum of the interest plus
      principal (Liu, 2020). The progressive interest rate setting encourages the issuer's conversion willingness. If
      conversion is achieved early in the bond's lifecycle, the issuer need not pay the increasingly higher interest or
      the compensation and principal at maturity (Mansi et al., 2021). Therefore, issuers generally hope for early
      conversion. The pure bond value is usually calculated using the discounted cash flow method, with the discount
      rate typically being the yield to maturity of corporate bonds with a similar term and credit rating (Liu, 2020).
      As the bond matures, its remaining interest payments increase, and the discount factor for the final redemption
      compensation decreases, making longer-issued bonds typically have a higher pure bond value under the same
      conditions (Flor et al., 2023).</p>
