      <b>Redemption Clause.</b> The redemption clause is a right of the issuer, including maturity redemption and
      conditional redemption (forced redemption). Maturity redemption typically occurs at bond maturity, where the
      issuer redeems the unconverted bonds at a predetermined price. According to standard conditional redemption terms,
      when the stock price of the underlying continuously exceeds a trigger price (usually set as 15 out of 30 trading
      days where the stock price is not lower than 130% of the conversion price), or the unconverted balance is less
      than 30 million yuan, the issuer has the right to redeem all or part of the unconverted bonds at a predetermined
      price (usually slightly above 100 yuan, for example, the bond face value plus accrued interest) (Helwege et al.,
      2017).

      <b> Resale Clause.</b> The resale clause is a protective right for bond investors. The clause stipulates that
      within a specified period, if the stock price significantly drops (e.g., continuously below 70% of the conversion
      price over the past 30 trading days), investors have the right to resell part or all of their convertible bonds
      back to the issuer at a certain price. In the last two interest-bearing years, bondholders can exercise the resale
      right once after the resale conditions are first met each year; if bondholders do not declare and implement the
      resale within the announced resale declaration period after first meeting the resale conditions, the resale right
      cannot be exercised again within that interest year, and bondholders cannot exercise the partial resale right
      multiple times (Dutordoir et al., 2023).

      <b>Downward Adjustment Clause.</b> The downward adjustment clause is a right of the issuer. The clause specifies
      that when the stock price significantly drops (e.g., if half of the closing prices within the past 20 trading days
      are below 85% of the conversion price, usually weaker conditions than the resale clause), the issuer has the right
      to adjust the conversion price of the bonds downward to a certain extent. The most direct meaning of the downward
      adjustment clause is to prevent the actual trigger of the resale clause, and issuers might choose to adjust
      downward in other situations as well. For example, 1) if the stock price is low, but the company anticipates an
      upward movement in stock prices, it might choose to adjust downward to reduce the difficulty of triggering forced
      conversion, ensuring smooth conversion; 2) if the major shareholders hold a large amount of convertible bonds,
      their willingness to propose a downward adjustment might increase when the stock price is low, for the purpose of
      getting out of their positions (Liuling et al., 2022).
