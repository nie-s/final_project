      <b>Conversion.</b> Facilitating conversion is the most common exit strategy for convertible bond products and is
      likely the outcome both issuers and investors prefer. For the issuer, successful conversion means the debt
      associated with the convertible bond is transformed into equity, sparing the issuer from paying the remaining
      interest, principal, and maturity compensation, as well as worrying about the financial costs of the convertible
      bonds. For investors, the timing to choose conversion often occurs when the underlying stock continuously rises
      triggering forced redemption or when the convertible bond itself presents a negative premium arbitrage
      opportunity, both of which usually provide investors with a chance for positive returns (Oster, 2020).

      <b>Issuer Maturity Redemption. </b>If the underlying stock continues in a downward trend, then regardless of
      whether the issuer chooses to adjust downward, it won't make a difference, and the convertible bond will
      ultimately head towards maturity redemption or even resale (do Ros√°rio Correia, 2008).
    </p>

      <b>Reselling to the Issuer.</b> For the issuer of the convertible bonds, reselling is not good news, as it means
      the issuer will have to repay the principal and interest ahead of schedule. The greatest advantage of issuing
      convertible bonds should be that after conversion, the issuer no longer needs to pay subsequent interest and
      principal. Therefore, when a company faces the pressure of convertible bond reselling, it usually prefers to use
      certain methods (such as the downward adjustment of the conversion price mentioned later) to try to avoid the
      actual triggering of the resell clause (Bratton, 2016).

      <b>Conditional Redemption.</b> For rational investors, forced redemption of convertible bonds will encourage
      investors to complete the conversion. Of course, before the actual redemption date, investors can choose to sell
      their convertible bonds, but as the redemption date approaches, the last holders will face the above choice, so
      after the company exercises the forced redemption clause, the remaining amount of convertible bonds is usually
      entirely converted into stock. The actual occurrence of conditional redemption does not seem very reasonable,
      mainly because after triggering forced redemption, choosing to convert often can result in higher value. However,
      in extreme cases, if after triggering forced redemption the stock price rapidly falls, causing the parity of the
      convertible bonds to drop below the forced redemption price, then redemption may still actually occur (Simpson &
      Grossmann, 2017).
